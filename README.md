# Python Projects 

A collection of python projects ranging from Tkinter to PyQt, Simple programs to PyGame. This repository contains the total number of 
Python Programs I have ever done. So, many new projects will arrive as well. 
# Modules

I have created separate folders for each of the projects so that you can find projects and navigate through them easily.

# Todo
- Organising the files
- Add more projects!
- Updating the existing codebase

**Most of the apps are tested in Windows 10. However, some of them are also tested in Mac OS.**
